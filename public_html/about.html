                <h2> About the Show </h2>

                <p>There's a student dead at the library, and the whole campus is
                   asking one question: "Who Dunn It?" In this thrilling 
                   account of life on the campus of a small college in the middle
                   of Iowa, interviewers search for the answer to that very 
                   question. Along the way they discover secrets of students and
                   teachers and somehow find some humor in this grim situation. 
                </p>
                <p>Ian was quite a strange guy. He didn't have many friends on campus and could usually be found sitting by himself. So if Ian didn't really talk to anyone on campus, who killed him? The only three people Ian was ever seen with were Courtney a pretty blonde, Ethan the menace of campus, and Aaron a basketball player and Courtney's boyfriend. Join us and officer Kyle on this journey into Ian's real story and find out who dunn it!
